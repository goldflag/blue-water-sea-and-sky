//! The coast in the waves (native only): what a shore leaves of the open sea's waves near it. The wave field draws one
//! sea everywhere; near land three things take it apart, each a share of a wave's amplitude that the wave reads
//! (`shaders/waves.wgsl`'s `shore_at`) apply to its displacement, slopes and foam:
//!
//! - **Fetch.** Wind waves grow with the open water the wind has blown over (the fetch). In the lee of land the sea
//!   is young: its peak wavelength is the fetch's, `λp = 0.0130·(U²/g)^0.34·F^0.66` (JONSWAP's
//!   `fp = 3.5·(g/U)·(gF/U²)^-0.33` with `λ = g/(2π·f²)`), and waves longer than that have not yet been raised. Each
//!   cascade keeps `exp(-5/8·λ²·(λp(F)⁻² − λp(F_open)⁻²))` of each wave's amplitude (the low-frequency side of
//!   JONSWAP's `exp(-5/4·(fp/f)⁴)`), and the root of the energy its waves keep ([`band_fetch_table`], tabled over
//!   fetch for the shader), so a band keeps its short waves where the fetch takes its long ones. The fetch is
//!   Saville's effective fetch: the open water upwind along seven bearings within 45° of the wind's, weighed by cos².
//!   A sea with no land within the open fetch upwind is the open sea, drawn as it is.
//! - **Swell.** The long swell (the sea hulls ride and its spread, `crate::hull_sea`) comes from far off, along the
//!   wind. Land upwind casts its shadow; the swell fills back in over [`SWELL_SHELTER_M`] of open water (diffraction
//!   round the land's ends). Near the hulls it is kept whole: they ride the simulation's sea, which knows no coast.
//! - **Depth.** No wave stands higher than [`BREAKING`] of the water's depth: in the surf zone the waves break and
//!   their height falls with the depth to nothing at the waterline. The shader draws the breakers as foam lines
//!   running in toward the beach once a swell period, closer together as the water shoals.
//!
//! [`ShoreMap`] is the CPU half: the land's heights on its own grid, and the upwind open water (wind sea and swell) on a
//! coarser one, built off the frame loop's thread from a land window and the wind's direction. The pure functions are
//! what the shader evaluates, for tests and CPU callers.
